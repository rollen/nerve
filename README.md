What is Nervecenter?
------------

Nervecenter is a web framework for node.

Its built on concepts like dependency injection and testability to provide the app author maximum control over his app. This control makes testing on all levels, including the controllers, relatively easy. 


### Why use nervecenter
* If your a fan of dependency injection in your code, nervecenter has its own dependency system and can help you program in that manner. 
* Out of the box support for Angular.js, its a great way to learn Angular.js
